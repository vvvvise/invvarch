# INVVARCH

## Introducing:

#### [Introducing: Japanese version](./README_ja.md)

### A Post-Structuralist Approach to Software Design

After nearly 30 years as a software architect, I have synthesized my experience into a singular, comprehensive theory. This journey has been the most profound gift of my career and life.

INVVARCH, a product currently in alpha development, is my attempt to apply **_[Post-structuralism through original research](./docs/concepts/ApplicationOfPoststructuralismToDesignTheoryThroughOriginalResearch.md)_** to software design. Inspired by biological motifs like RNA synthesis (PCR methods), this paradigm fundamentally redefines how software structure is conceived. Here, "structure" is not designed‚Äîit emerges from the design itself, evolving autonomously through differential absorption.

At its core, this paradigm uses a meta-design schema as the foundation. From this schema, ‚Äústructure‚Äù is mechanically generated, mirroring how DNA encodes and manifests life. Software modifications no longer require direct adjustments to entities. Instead, they are implemented through schema language changes, akin to editing genetic sequences.

The system functions as a primitive organism, with:

```md
* A consistent schema space (the "DNA")
* A database (the "organism")
* A membrane covering the design's surface (the "synaptic field")
```

This ensures an interface that remains lightweight, adaptable, and responsive to user inputs, continually evolving in real-time. The result is a paradigm where "design is immune to unknown errors."

In essence, INVVARCH represents a vision where software is both the plan and the design itself. Just as DNA gives rise to living organisms, structure emerges from the plan, harmonizing dynamically over time.

I am the sole developer working on this open-source project. [If development proceeds without delays](https://github.com/VVVVISE/lego/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open), I anticipate a beta release by late 2025 and an alpha version by early 2027.

## Get Involved:

If you‚Äôre interested in joining the development, sponsoring the project, exploring partial integration into your business, or scheduling an in-depth discussion, I would love to hear from you. Let‚Äôs shape the future of software design together.
