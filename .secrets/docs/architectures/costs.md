### **Difficulty and Effort Estimation for Solo Implementation of INVARCH**

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**
1. **Difficulty**:
   - Technical complexity of each module.
   - Whether new technologies need to be learned.
   - Effort required for integration and debugging.

2. **Effort**:
   - Time needed for implementing each module.
   - Transitioning from prototyping to production-level code.
   - Automation of testing and deployment.

### **Difficulty Assessment**
Each component is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 (1: Easy ~ 5: Very Difficult).

| Component                        | Difficulty | Explanation                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OOUI Framework**               | 4          | Designing highly abstracted, reusable components with dynamic property management and data-driven rendering is complex. |
| **Schema Editor**                | 4          | Real-time schema generation through GUI and synchronization with GraphQL models adds significant complexity. |
| **Real-Time Preview**            | 3          | Real-time data synchronization between client and server using WebSocket or GraphQL Subscriptions. |
| **Code Generation**              | 4          | Automatically generating frontend, backend, and API code requires a deep understanding of multilayered architecture. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline**               | 2          | While GitHub Actions setup is straightforward, precise configuration for parallel testing and deployment is needed. |
| **UnitTest (Vitest)**            | 2          | Relatively simple, but ensuring comprehensive test coverage requires effort.                     |
| **ComponentTest (Storybook)**    | 3          | Testing dynamic rendering of UI components with integration into Storybook can be time-consuming. |
| **E2ETest (Playwright)**         | 3          | Writing multi-browser test scenarios requires effort but is not technically challenging.          |
| **Deployment (AWS/GitHub)**      | 2          | Basic deployment scripts are straightforward but require careful management of staging and production settings. |

### **Effort Estimation**
Below is the estimated time required for full-time development (40 hours/week) by a solo developer:

| Component                        | Estimated Time (Weeks) | Explanation                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **OOUI Framework**               | 8                      | Includes abstraction design, dynamic property management, and style handling in a full-stack implementation. |
| **Schema Editor**                | 6                      | GUI design, real-time synchronization, and data model generation.                               |
| **Real-Time Preview**            | 4                      | Implementing real-time communication using WebSocket or GraphQL Subscriptions.                  |
| **Code Generation**              | 6                      | Building pipelines for schema-driven generation of APIs, frontend, and backend.                 |
| **CI/CD Pipeline**               | 2                      | Setting up GitHub Actions, parallel testing, and automated deployment.                          |
| **UnitTest (Vitest)**            | 2                      | Creating test cases and measuring test coverage.                                                |
| **ComponentTest (Storybook)**    | 3                      | Documenting and testing each component in isolation.                                            |
| **E2ETest (Playwright)**         | 3                      | Writing E2E scenarios and testing across multiple browsers.                                     |
| **Deployment (AWS/GitHub)**      | 2                      | Configuring deployment for staging and production environments.                                 |

**Total Time**: Approximately **36 weeks** (9 months)

### **Factors Influencing Effort**

1. **Existing Skills**:
   - Experience with React, GraphQL, Prisma, Vitest, and Playwright can significantly reduce development time.
2. **Prototyping**:
   - Reusing existing prototypes can shorten implementation time for OOUI and Schema Editor.
3. **Testing Scope**:
   - Effort varies based on the number and complexity of required test cases.

### **Proposed Implementation Plan**

#### **1. Phased Development**
1. **Phase 1**:
   - Focus on core features: OOUI framework, Schema Editor, and real-time synchronization (approximately 20 weeks).
2. **Phase 2**:
   - Develop advanced features: Code Generation, E2ETest, and Deployment automation (approximately 16 weeks).

#### **2. MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
   - Narrow the initial release scope to include only the Schema Editor and basic OOUI functionalities.

#### **3. Parallel Development**
   - Conduct test design (UnitTest, ComponentTest) concurrently with feature development.
