## **Introduction: Transforming Design Theory in a Virtualized Society**  
Modern society has entered a new phase, termed the "virtualized society," driven by the widespread adoption of the Internet. In this society, physical constraints are significantly diminished, and "structures" exist merely as data representations in memory. This transformation demands a reevaluation of the traditional relationship between "design" and "structure," fostering the development of a theoretical framework where design inherently encapsulates its resultant structures. This paper redefines design theory from the perspective of post-structuralism and explores its potential applications and implications.

## **Characteristics of a Virtualized Society and the Primacy of Design**  
In a virtualized society, "structure" is no longer governed by physical constraints but rather emerges as a result of "design." This paradigm shift gives rise to the following key considerations:

1. **Reversibility of the Temporal Axis**  
   The virtualized society accumulates comprehensive records of its evolutionary processes since the inception of the Internet. This data enables the design of future structures based on a retrospective understanding of their development, establishing a new paradigm in which design holds causal precedence over structure.

2. **Data Models as the DNA of Society**  
   Components of a virtualized society are abstracted into observable data models. These models, conceptualized as the "DNA of society," empower designers to manipulate structures akin to genetic engineering, thereby enabling the evolution of structures through design.

3. **Dynamic Structure Generation and Observer Dependency**  
   Structures are dynamic and can vary based on the perspective and objectives of the observer. This property disrupts the traditional notion of static structures, positioning design as a flexible and adaptive framework capable of embedding future-oriented planning.

## **Evolutionary Perspectives on Design and the Potential for Integration**  
This paradigm introduces an evolutionary perspective to design theory, emphasizing the emergent and integrative nature of design through schema interactions:

1. **Emergence of Evolutionary Structures**  
   Interactions and mutations among schema models generate new structures beyond the original intentions of their designers. This phenomenon, reminiscent of random mutations and selective processes in RNA synthesis, frames design as a process of emergent evolution.

2. **Expansive Diversification of Design**  
   In a virtualized society, schema models do not adhere to a monolithic data paradigm but are shared and expanded across a network of diverse designers. This interconnectedness significantly enhances the diversity and adaptability of the design space.

## **Societal Impacts and Ethical Challenges**  
The primacy of design in a virtualized society brings forth both opportunities and challenges:

1. **Risks of Individual Optimization and Social Fragmentation**  
   While the generation of personalized structures enhances efficiency and flexibility, it also risks exacerbating social fragmentation and isolation. Addressing this issue requires embedding mechanisms that ensure societal harmony within the design process.

2. **Ethical Responsibility of Design Actors**  
   Democratizing schema manipulation for non-engineers promotes inclusivity but necessitates safeguards against misuse or malicious intent. Establishing robust norms and mechanisms to mitigate adverse societal impacts is imperative.

3. **Data Sovereignty and Privacy**  
   Treating data models as the DNA of society demands careful consideration of ownership and usage boundaries. Particularly, the application of personal data in design necessitates a solid ethical and legal foundation.

## **New Horizons for Design Theory**  
The post-structuralist approach to design theory offers the following novel possibilities:

1. **Real-Time Reactive Software Development**  
   By automating code generation based on schema models, this approach enables the immediate realization of design intentions, transforming the software development process.

2. **Redefining Social Design**  
   Harnessing the characteristics of a virtualized society, this framework facilitates the creation of dynamic and adaptable social structures, paving the way for innovative approaches to societal design.

3. **Harmonizing Design and Structure**  
   By emphasizing the dynamic relationship between design and structure, this approach establishes a framework that embraces evolutionary changes and integrates them seamlessly into the design process.

## **Conclusion: Insights for Future Society**  
Post-structuralist design theory redefines the conventional structure-centric approach, emphasizing the primacy of design. This framework unleashes the full potential of design in a virtualized society, addressing both technical advancements and broader social and ethical implications. As this theory evolves through continued research and implementation, it serves as a human-centered response to the challenges of an AI-integrated future. It signifies an intentional effort to shape the trajectory of society through design, offering a vision for harmonizing innovation with human values.

In addition, the implementation and feasibility verification phase has already been completed for each individual point of the software design method that applies this unique post-structuralism. The current development phase is aimed at realizing a software development suite that integrates each of the elements included here.
